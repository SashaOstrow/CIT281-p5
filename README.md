Overview

For this project, you will be creating some type of a game using a JavaScript class, a web server, a client program, and separate code modules.
What game you choose to create is entirely up to you, so long as your final product meets the project requirements. You can use AI to assist with this project,
and how much is up to you. The more you interact with AI to build your code, the more you'll learn. Simply asking AI to create everything will not help you learn.
Some aspects of the final project will most likely be mostly AI-generated, such as the client components, as this class does not focus on client-side development.

The point of my video game is to be able to battle a monster that gets randomly generated with each monster having different levels of health and having the player be able to choose between different weapons that do different ranges of damage. The player has to be careful because the monster that gets randomly generated can attack them too, so depending on what monster they get, and what weapon they choose will determine if they will lose or win the game.


This project combined creativity with real-world development tools, bringing together **backend logic**, **server communication**, and **frontend interactivity** into one cohesive, playable experience.
